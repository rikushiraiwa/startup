## HTML Notes

There are some sections for THML such as head, hearder, body, main, footer. Those sections represents each location. 
div and span is different usage in terms of block and inline. If it is block, it can be only that element but inline can line up horizontaly. 
I used two type of input element, input and textare. 
There are also useful element such as Button and a tag. Button is leterally button, while a is able to contain link with words that I input inside a tag.


## CSS Notes
I used display: flex; to align elements properly. header, main, and footer were styled to create a clear structure.Margin, padding, and border were adjusted to make sure elements are not too close or overlapping.
I changed the font size and color to make the page easy to read. Background colors were also applied to different sections.
Styled button to make it stand out. input and textarea were adjusted for better usability.
When the user hovers over a button, the background color changes to give feedback.
Used max-width and percentage-based widths so the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## React1
-React uses componets so I do not need to add navbar for every page, as well as footer. BrowserRouter is changeing Routes componet. Only what is inside of Route tag is changed so other element of app.jsx will stay the same. 
-I can use BootStrap for CSS. It is acually better for this project since I do not need to have css folder and file. 
-In React, there is a way to creat a Form by using Form.Group and Form.control. There is Table also.

## React2
-useState: useState allows managing state within a React component. It helps store and update values dynamically without reloading the page. This is useful for handling user input, toggling elements, and managing lists.
-useEffect: useEffect is used for handling side effects in a React component. It runs after the component renders and can be used for fetching data, updating local storage, or listening to events. It also allows cleanup actions, preventing memory leaks when components unmount.
-Practical Application: useState is useful for tracking form inputs, managing task lists, or updating UI elements dynamically.
-useEffect is helpful for persisting data with localStorage, handling API calls, or synchronizing UI with external changes.

# Service
-Express.js: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs. It simplifies handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware integration. It is widely used for creating backend services that communicate with databases and frontend applications.
-REST API Endpoints: RESTful APIs allow communication between the frontend and backend using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. Each endpoint serves a specific function, such as retrieving, creating, updating, or deleting data.
-Data Persistence: Server-side applications often store and retrieve data from databases or in-memory storage. JSON format is commonly used for data exchange between the server and client.
-Practical Application: Express.js is useful for setting up backend servers, handling authentication, and managing API routes.
-REST API endpoints help in fetching user data, saving journal entries, managing schedules, and updating tasks dynamically.
-Data persistence allows users to store and retrieve their information efficiently, ensuring seamless interaction with the application.
