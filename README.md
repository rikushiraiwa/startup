### Key features

- Register goals
- Input schdules and tasks
- Write a jurnal

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Structure every letters and words with desirable font.
- **CSS** - Design responsibly for mobile size screen.
- **React** - Making componets and adds webiste a functions for example, type schedule, task, and goals. And also fetching request to the server side to process user inputs.
- **Service** - process user input such as creating or updating schedules, tasks, and goals, and will provide the       necessary data to the React frontend through APIs. It also manages user authentication and interactions with the database.
- **DB/Login** - DB is for keep the datas that users input such as schedule, task, and goals. Login is to be able to provide singple user and keep thier data by giving each user an ID so that DB can tell wichi person to interact. 
- **WebSocket** -  will be used to enable real-time updates for schedules, tasks, and goals. For example, when a user updates their schedule, the changes will immediately reflect on all connected devices without needing to refresh the page.

LocalStorage was used to persist data for goals, journal entries, tasks, and schedules. State updates and UI interactions were implemented using useState.
- [x] **Hooks** - I used useState to manage user input and dynamic updates in multiple components. I used useEffect to handle data persistence with LocalStorage and simulate WebSocket behavior. Cleanup functions were included in useEffect to prevent memory leaks when components unmount.
